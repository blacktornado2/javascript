- Ever

- JavaScript -> Everything happens inside a execution context
- Execution Context = Memory component(Variable Environment) + Code component(Thread of Execution)
- JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language

How a program runs in JS
1. Global Execution Context made
2. Memory Creation Phase
3. Code Execution Phase

Function Call stack works as expected: Call stack maintains the order of execution of execution contexts
Call Stack synonyms:
 - Execution Context Stack
 - Program Stack
 - Control Stack
 - Runtime Stack
 - Machine Stack
